### What is it?
It's a meta-tag based addon to your site that lets you choose how your site/project is presented when it's shared on social media.
You can specify different things in the configuration such as:

`og:title` which is the title of the project.  
`og:type` here you chose what type of project you're presenting, it could be a video, a blog, a picture or a regular site just to give some examples.  
`og:image` this is the image that is shown when sharing your project.  
`og:url` here you specify the link/url to the project.  

### How I used it
I used it as shown in the guides on their site. I just followed the steps and implemented the four tags above in my head.html.
