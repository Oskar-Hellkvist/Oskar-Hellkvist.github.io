I chose to include some different tags in the humans.txt just to try.

## What is humans.txt?
It is a text file included in the root of the website. It is used as a way for the creators/authors of the website to share their information. 
## Why is it used
Website owners do not often like the developers plastering their name visibly on the website because it's intrusive. This is why the humans.txt file is so great, since it doesn't get in the way of the website contents and the authors have an outlet to share who they are.
