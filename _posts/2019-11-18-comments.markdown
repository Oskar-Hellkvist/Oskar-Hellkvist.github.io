I implemented comments on every post in the following steps:

1. I took a look at [their site][disqus-url] for more understanding on how to implement it.
2. I created an account for their service and subscribed to the free option.
3. I checked for their "universal solution" code which had my user info tailored into it, copied it and pasted it into my `disqus-comments.html`.
4. I added some configuration in the config.yml file to enable it.
```
disqus:
  shortname: oh222gw
```
5. And lastly I set comments to true on every post.
```
comments: true
```
