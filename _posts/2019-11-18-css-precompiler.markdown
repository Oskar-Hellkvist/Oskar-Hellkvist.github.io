I think CSS-precompilers are good, they let you combine regular CSS and programming which makes it easier to make more sophisticated styling.

## Comparing CSS precompilers to regular CSS
Regular CSS is quite limited in its flexibility and even with the recent updates there still is no support for e.g rule-nesting which is really handy and makes for a smoother workflow. Precompilers like SASS are still used today but they're slowly falling out of fashion as CSS gets the features that precompilers introduced. They are still useful since all the precompiler features aren't implemented and i prefer using precompilers instead of writing regular CSS.

## Which techniques i use
I use SASS for writing style and the most used features by me are variables and rule-nesting by far. It's so much more easy to see where the different tags are located in the html when working with nested rules because of the structural resemblance between the stylesheet and the html document.

## Pros and cons
Pros with precompilers are the features which doesn't exist in regular CSS that simplifies writing style. Cons are that it's a bit more tedious to set up when you're starting your project.
