## Oskar Hellkvist
Hi, I'm Oskar Hellkvist and im 20 years old. I'm currently studying software development at Linn√©aus University. In my freetime I like to either play videogames, hang out with friends or write code. I have been interested in programming for at least 3 years by now and I just find the idea of creating your own tools and software very fascinating and the only limit to what you can do is your knowledge and creativity. I also like improving my skills both socially and academically and that's why I chose to study, to throw my self out there into unknown territory.

Well, that's a bit about me :)
